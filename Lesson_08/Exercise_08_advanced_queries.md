# Exercise 1: Analyzing Monthly Sales Trends with LAG in BigQuery

## Objective

Learn to use the `LAG` function and `OVER` clause in SQL to analyze monthly sales trends in BigQuery.

## Understanding the LAG Function and OVER Clause with Sales Data

### The LAG Function

The `LAG` function is like looking back in a timeline of your sales records. It enables you to see the sales figure from the previous month, essential for comparing and understanding trends.

### The OVER Clause â€“ Organizing Data Chronologically

The `OVER` clause sets the order for your data, crucial for the `LAG` function to work correctly. By organizing the sales data in chronological order (using `ORDER BY year_month`), `LAG` correctly identifies the sales figure from the preceding month.

### Example

- January Sales: \$100,000 --> NONE
- February Sales: \$120,000 --> January Sales: \$100,000
- March Sales: \$110,000 --> February Sales: \$120,000

When analyzing March, `LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY year_month)` fetches February's sales, allowing you to calculate the growth rate from February to March.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Monthly Sales Trend Analysis Query

### Step 1: Calculating Total Monthly Sales

**Task**: Write a query to calculate the total sales for each month.

**Syntax and Example**:
```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m', orderdate) AS year_month,
  SUM(CAST(totaldue AS FLOAT64)) AS total_sales
FROM
  [Your Table]
GROUP BY year_month
```

**Skeleton**:
```sql
SELECT
  /* Use FORMAT_TIMESTAMP to format orderdate as year_month */
  /* Use SUM to calculate total sales */
FROM
  `adventureworks.dwh_sales_data`
/* Remember to GROUP BY year_month */
```

### Step 2: Retrieving Previous Month's Sales

**Task**: Use the `LAG` function to fetch the total sales of the previous month.

**Syntax and Example**:
```sql
LAG(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY column_name)
```

**Skeleton**:
```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
  /* Insert your Step 1 query here */
)
SELECT
  year_month,
  total_sales,
  /* Use LAG to retrieve previous month's sales */
FROM
  MonthlySales
```

### Step 3: Calculating the Growth Rate

**Task**: Calculate the month-over-month growth rate in sales.

**Syntax and Example**:
```sql
ROUND(((current_value - previous_value) / previous_value) * 100, 2)
```

**Skeleton**:
```sql
/* Include your full query from Step 2 here */
SELECT
  year_month,
  total_sales,
  previous_month_sales,
  /* Calculate growth rate using the provided syntax */
FROM
  /* Your source table from Step 2 */
```

### Step 4: Putting It All Together

**Skeleton for the Complete Query**:
```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
  /* Insert your query from Step 1 here */
)
SELECT
  year_month,
  /* Insert total_sales calculation */
  /* Insert previous_month_sales calculation using LAG */
  /* Insert growth rate calculation */
FROM
  MonthlySales
ORDER BY
  year_month;
```

## Conclusion

This exercise will help you understand and apply the `LAG` function and `OVER` clause in SQL, enabling you to analyze trends in monthly sales data. The step-by-step approach and simplified templates are designed to make the learning process more accessible and enjoyable.


# Exercise 2: Segmenting Customers Based on Spending Percentiles

## Objective

Learn to use the `PERCENTILE_CONT` function in SQL to analyze customer spending patterns and segment customers based on their spending percentiles in BigQuery.

### Further Reading on Percentiles

For a more in-depth understanding of percentiles and their applications in statistics, you can refer to the Wikipedia article on the topic: [Percentile - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile).


## Understanding PERCENT_RANK and the OVER Clause

### What is PERCENT_RANK?

`PERCENT_RANK` is a window function in SQL used to calculate the percentile rank of each row within a partition of a result set. The percentile rank indicates the relative standing of a value within the dataset.

### How Does PERCENT_RANK Work?

- The function assigns a rank to each row, with the lowest value getting a rank of 0.
- The highest value receives a rank of 1.
- Intermediate values are assigned a percentile rank that reflects their position in the ordered set.

### Syntax of PERCENT_RANK

```sql
PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column_name)
```

### The OVER Clause

- The `OVER` clause defines the window (or set of rows) over which the `PERCENT_RANK` function operates.
- It determines how the data is partitioned and ordered before the function is applied.
- The `ORDER BY` part of the `OVER` clause is crucial as it defines the order in which the data is ranked.

### Choosing the Right Column for OVER

- The column you choose for the `ORDER BY` part of the `OVER` clause should reflect the metric you're interested in ranking.
- In the context of customer spending, this would typically be a column representing the amount spent, total sales, or similar financial metrics.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Customer Spending Segmentation Query

## Step 1: Calculating Total Spending per Customer

**Task**: Write a query to calculate the total spending for each customer.

**Hints**:
- Use the `SUM` function to calculate the total spending.
- Multiply `unitprice` by `orderqty` for each order.
- Group the results by `customerid`.

**Skeleton**:
```sql
SELECT
  customerid,
  /* Complete this line */
FROM
  `adventureworks.dwh_sales_data`
/* Complete this line */
```

## Step 2: Ranking Customers by Spending

**Task**: Once you have total spending per customer, rank these customers based on their spending.

**Hints**:
- Use the `PERCENT_RANK` function to assign a percentile rank.
- Order the results by total spending.

**Skeleton**:
```sql
WITH CustomerSpending AS (
  /* Insert your Step 1 query here */
)
SELECT
  /* Complete this line for PERCENT_RANK */
  customerid,
  total_spending
FROM
  CustomerSpending
```

## Step 3: Categorizing Customers Based on Spending Percentiles

**Task**: Use the percentile ranks to categorize customers into spending groups.

**Hints**:
- Use a `CASE` statement to assign categories.
- Define categories such as 'Low Spender', 'Medium Spender', etc., based on percentile ranks.

**Skeleton**:
```sql
WITH
  CustomerSpending AS (
    /* Insert your Step 1 query here */
  ),
  PercentileRanks AS (
    /* Insert your Step 2 query here */
  )
SELECT
  /* Complete the CASE statement */
FROM
  PercentileRanks
/* Remember to add the GROUP BY clause */
```

## Step 4: Counting Customers in Each Category

**Task**: Count the number of customers in each spending category.

**Hints**:
- Use `COUNT(*)` to count customers.
- Group the results by the spending category.

**Skeleton**:
```sql
/* Include your full query from Step 3 here */
GROUP BY
  /* Complete this line */
ORDER BY
  /* Complete this line */
```

## Step 5: Putting It All Together

## Skeleton for the Complete Query
``` sql
WITH
  CustomerSpending AS (
    /* Insert your query from Step 1 here */
  ),
  PercentileRanks AS (
    /* Insert your query from Step 2 here */
  )
SELECT
  /* Insert your CASE statement from Step 3 here */
  /* Insert the COUNT function from Step 4 here */
FROM
  /* Insert your source from Step 3 here */
GROUP BY
  /* Complete this line */
ORDER BY
  /* Complete this line */
```

## Conclusion

This exercise provides a detailed understanding of the `PERCENT_RANK` function and the `OVER` clause, essential tools in SQL for analyzing data distributions and rankings. By completing this exercise, you'll gain practical skills in constructing complex SQL queries for real-world data analysis scenarios.
